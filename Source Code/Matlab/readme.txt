**please note that, if you will run top_module.m then it will start with beginning and train the model on new shuffle input data. So, accuracy will differ every time.

I have checked the same 493 inpute test data and W21 on verilog. I got the best accuracy 87.672%.

------------------------------
**for runing demo.m

I was not able to save my 1st best W21 data as .mat file.

But i have save the 2nd best W21 which i stored as .mat file:

file name is fix_float_accuracy_86_0041.mat

please load it. because every time my train W21 will change and it may affect my accuracy.

By using command window:

>> load fix_float_accuracy_86_0041

then you will find the 100 % test accuracy on same 10 test input data.
